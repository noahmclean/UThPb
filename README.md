# UThPb

This repository contains software to make plots and perform calculations for U-Pb geochronology data subject to intermediate daughter isotope disequilibrium conditions that can be measured or assumed.  Initially, these comprise the 238U - 234U - 230Th - 226Ra - 206Pb and the 235U - 231Pa - 207Pb decay chains.

The algorithms that underpin the plots and calculations are being documented in a manuscript titled, "New Ways to Calculate U-Th and U-Th-Pb dates and uncertainties."  

These algorithms and software tools were created from discussion and collaboration with Chris Smith and David Richards (U of Bristol), and Nick Roberts and Dan Condon (NIGL/BGS) as part of the "Sharpening the U-Th Chronometer" NERC grant.
